<h1>My Project</h1>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<img class="img-myphoto" src="C:\Users\James\OneDrive - RMIT University\My Project\myphoto.PNG" alt="photo of me" style="width:120px;height:150px;">
<p>My name is James Lay and I am of Chinese descent, although I cannot speak Mandarin and Cantonese, rather a dialect called Hakka. My student number is s3902436, which means my student email is s3902436@student.rmit.edu.au. An interesting fact about me is I’ve watched 105 days worth of anime, which is 2520 hours and along with my hobby of watching anime, I also enjoy playing games on my computer such as league of legends, valorant, CSGO and osu!.</p>
<h3>Interest in IT</h3>

<p>It was around the start of year 8 when I was really active on my computer as my friend introduced me to my first computer game CSGO, a first-person shooter game. Before that, I was mostly a mobile gamer playing clash of clans. Hence, up until now, I have had an interest in how coding works in order to make such successful games that many of us play today. I chose to come to RMIT because of many reasons, but notably due to the reputation that IT at RMIT holds. Other reasons include shorter commute times in comparison to other universities, and the accessible entry score. During my studies at RMIT, I expect to learn how to program, solve, support, troubleshoot and design things such as websites whilst building a strong relationship with teammates to improve my communication skills for the future.</p>
<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/role/database-administrator">Database Administrator</a>
<p>My ideal job is similar in terms of the nature of a database administrator. However, what makes this job the most appealing is the power to control the database management system within a corporation. The employment of SQL in the corporation to manage and store data protocols is one of the many skills that you must possess in order to be recruited for this position. While my SQL skills are currently not up to a professional level, I can compensate for my knowledge and experience of Microsoft Azure. Furthermore, I should keep practicing on SQL in my practical database concept classes and during my free time. By successfully graduating from IT at RMIT, I will have the necessary qualifications for the position.</p>

<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
<p>As seen in the graphs, I am not a very outgoing person, although not completely introverted, so I will be able to articulate my thoughts clearly to a team. Not a very good leader either but find myself the first one to speak if no one in the team does. I am also an auditory learner, denoting that I learn better through listening rather than visually and hands-on practical learning.</p>

<h3>Project Idea</h3>
<p>The project is on developing a 3D rhythm game that is a first-person shooter which should be played with a mouse and keyboard to click to the target, sort of like an aim trainer while shooting targets to the beat.This project should have a target audience of gamers who enjoy playing shooters. It will however only be useful for people who aim to improve at their favourite first-person shooting games. The image below shows the video game sales in the United States in 2018. 20.9% of video games that are bought are classified as shooters, meaning most gamers favour this genre over most genres, as portrayed in the image. Furthermore, I feel that a lot of people who enjoy this type of genre will also enjoy my project idea.</p>
<img class="img-statistics" src="C:\Users\James\OneDrive - RMIT University\My Project\statistics of game genre played.png" alt="statistics" style="width:400px;height:270px;">
<p>As it is a 3D rhythm first-person shooter game made primarily to help people to improve their aim in shooters, there will be targets, which look like enemy terrorists to shoot with the gun they are holding in the game with the focus of improving their flicking and reaction time. If you do not shoot it in time, it will shoot you deducting 10 of your health from 100. The targets will appear one at a time at different positions, and disappear when you shoot it, recurring until the end of the time limit. Scores are exponential and a headshot will reward the most points, followed by the body and finally the legs, so if they miss the target, their combo is broken. The targets will also appear along with the beat of a music simultaneously, hence adding a rhythm ‘feeling’ to the game and making it a rhythm first-person shooter game. Cocos2d is a free software for developing games using the program languages such as Python, C++, C# and Objective-C. I would want my game to be written in C# language only because osu!, a 2D circle clicking rhythm game was written in C# as well. The skills that are required to do this project is to simply know how to write codes. If this project is successful, gamers who mostly like the shooting genre can learn mechanics such as flicking and reaction time and can improve their aim in other games they enjoy, while clicking the targets to the beat of the music.</p>
